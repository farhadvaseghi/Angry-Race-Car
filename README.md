In this repo, you will get a simple step-by-step guide on how to create a racing game in Python. The library that we are going to use for this project is Pygame.Conceptually, the game is about driving a car along an endless track. You’ll be required to control your vehicle using arrow keys (left, right) and If you crash into blocks you’ll lose so be careful.
## Requirements  
To install Pygame, you need to open up your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
After installing Pygame we are ready to create our cool snake game.
## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/farhadvaseghi/Angry-Race-Car.git
cd Angry-Race-Car
python main.py
```
